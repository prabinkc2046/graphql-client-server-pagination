# GraphQL Project Overview

## Introduction

This project involves setting up a GraphQL server along with a GraphQL client to fetch and render data. The purpose is to demonstrate the implementation and functionality of GraphQL within a web application environment.

## Technologies Used

- **GraphQL**: Used for designing and implementing the API that provides a more efficient and powerful alternative to REST.
- **Apollo Server**: An open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client.
- **Apollo Client**: A comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.

## Setting Up the GraphQL Server

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system.
   - Set up a new Node.js project by running `npm init`.
   - Install Apollo Server and GraphQL by running `npm install apollo-server graphql`.

2. **Define Your Schema**:
   - Create a `schema.graphql` file to define your GraphQL schema.
   - Define types, queries, and mutations based on your application requirements.

3. **Create Resolvers**:
   - Implement resolver functions to fetch the data specified by the queries.

4. **Start the Server**:
   - Create an instance of ApolloServer, passing your schema and resolvers.
   - Start the server and listen on a specific port.

## Setting Up the GraphQL Client

1. **Install Apollo Client**:
   - Add Apollo Client to your frontend project by running `npm install @apollo/client graphql`.

2. **Connect to Your GraphQL Server**:
   - Configure Apollo Client with the URI of your GraphQL server.

3. **Fetching Data**:
   - Use the `useQuery` hook from Apollo Client to fetch data in your React components.

4. **Rendering Data**:
   - Render the data fetched from GraphQL in your UI components.

## Running the Application

- **Start the Server**: Navigate to the server directory and run `node server.js` to start your GraphQL server.
- **Launch the Client**: In your frontend project, run `npm start` to launch the web application.

This README provides a basic outline to get started with a GraphQL server and client. For more specific details, refer to the documentation of Apollo Server and Apollo Client.
